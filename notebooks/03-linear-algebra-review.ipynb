    "## Matrix Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Like vector operations, matrix operations are useful both for providing a concise description of potentially many arithmetic operations and for representing phenomena in the physical world. Also like vector operations, some matrix operations are performed elementwise (where each element of one matrix is combined with each element of another matrix to create a new matrix of the same size and shape) and some matrix operations are performed by applying a special order of operations. In general, formulating many arithmetic operations as matrix operations can help speed them up, by taking advantage of parallel computing techniques, like vectorized CPU operations or GPU operations. We will cover parallel operations in a later class, but for now it is helpful to know that one of the benefits of formulating computations as matrix operations is a speed benefit through parallel processing. \n",
